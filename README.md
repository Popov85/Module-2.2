# Module-2.2
UML-diagram of flowers.
A bunch of flowers consists of a set of different existing real flowers.
After we added a new type of flowers we created a new BunchExt class by extending Bunch-class.
All types of bunches implement Creatable interface that requires a class to realize createBunch() method (select N flowers of specified types from the heap).
